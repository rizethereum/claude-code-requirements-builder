# Claude Requirements Gathering System

An intelligent requirements gathering system that combines slash commands and MCP server for Claude Code. It progressively builds context through automated discovery, asks simple yes/no questions, and generates comprehensive requirements documentation.

## 🎯 Overview

This system transforms the requirements gathering process by:
- **Codebase-Aware Questions**: AI analyzes your code first, then asks informed questions
- **Simple Yes/No Format**: All questions are yes/no with smart defaults - just say "idk" to use defaults
- **Two-Phase Questioning**: 5 high-level questions for context, then 5 expert questions after code analysis  
- **Automated Documentation**: Generates comprehensive specs with specific file paths and patterns
- **Product Manager Friendly**: No code knowledge required to answer questions
- **MCP Server Support**: Available as both slash commands and MCP tools

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Using MCP Server (Recommended)

**Install via npm:**
```bash
# Test it works
npx claude-code-requirements

# Add to Claude Desktop config
```

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-code-requirements": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["claude-code-requirements"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then use the MCP tools:
- `requirements-start` - Begin gathering requirements
- `requirements-status` - Check progress  
- `requirements-current` - View active requirement
- `requirements-end` - Complete/cancel session
- `requirements-list` - List all requirements
- `requirements-remind` - Get workflow reminder

### Option 2: Using Slash Commands

```bash
# Start gathering requirements for a new feature
/requirements-start add user profile picture upload

# Check progress and continue
/requirements-status

# View current requirement details
/requirements-current

# List all requirements
/requirements-list

# End current requirement gathering
/requirements-end

# Quick reminder if AI strays off course
/remind
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Phase 1: Initial Setup & Codebase Analysis
```
User: /requirements-start add export functionality to reports
```
AI analyzes the entire codebase structure to understand the architecture, tech stack, and patterns.

### Phase 2: Context Discovery Questions
The AI asks 5 yes/no questions to understand the problem space:
```
Q1: Will users interact with this feature through a visual interface?
(Default if unknown: YES - most features have UI components)

User: yes

Q2: Does this feature need to work on mobile devices?
(Default if unknown: YES - mobile-first is standard)

User: idk
AI: ✓ Using default: YES

[Continues through all 5 questions before recording answers]
```

### Phase 3: Targeted Context Gathering (Autonomous)
AI autonomously:
- Searches for specific files based on discovery answers
- Reads relevant code sections
- Analyzes similar features in detail
- Documents technical constraints and patterns

### Phase 4: Expert Requirements Questions
With deep context, asks 5 detailed yes/no questions:
```
Q1: Should we use the existing ExportService at services/ExportService.ts?
(Default if unknown: YES - maintains architectural consistency)

User: yes

Q2: Will PDF exports need custom formatting beyond the standard template?
(Default if unknown: NO - standard template covers most use cases)

User: no

[Continues through all 5 questions before recording answers]
```

### Phase 5: Requirements Documentation
Generates comprehensive spec with:
- Problem statement and solution overview
- Functional requirements from all 10 answers
- Technical requirements with specific file paths
- Implementation patterns to follow
- Acceptance criteria

## 📋 Command Reference

### `/requirements-start [description]`
Begins gathering requirements for a new feature or change.

**Example:**
```
/requirements-start implement dark mode toggle
```

### `/requirements-status` or `/requirements-current`
Shows current requirement progress and continues gathering.

**Output:**
```
📋 Active Requirement: dark-mode-toggle
Phase: Discovery Questions
Progress: 3/5 questions answered

Next: Q4: Should this sync across devices?
```

### `/requirements-end`
Finalizes current requirement, even if incomplete.

**Options:**
1. Generate spec with current info
2. Mark incomplete for later
3. Cancel and delete

### `/requirements-list`
Shows all requirements with their status.

**Output:**
```
✅ COMPLETE: dark-mode-toggle (Ready for implementation)
🔴 ACTIVE: user-notifications (Discovery 3/5)
⚠️ INCOMPLETE: data-export (Paused 3 days ago)
```

### `/remind` or `/requirements-remind`
Reminds AI to follow requirements gathering rules.

**Use when AI:**
- Asks open-ended questions
- Starts implementing code
- Asks multiple questions at once

## 🎯 Features

### Smart Defaults
Every question includes an intelligent default based on:
- Best practices
- Codebase patterns
- Context discovered

### Progressive Questioning
- **Phase 1**: Analyzes codebase structure first
- **Phase 2**: 5 high-level questions for product managers
- **Phase 3**: Autonomous deep dive into relevant code
- **Phase 4**: 5 expert questions based on code understanding

### Automatic File Management
- All files created automatically
- Progress tracked between sessions
- Can resume anytime

### Integration Ready
- Links to development sessions
- References PRs and commits
- Searchable requirement history

## 💡 Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Be Specific**: Clear initial descriptions help AI ask better questions
2. **Use Defaults**: "idk" is perfectly fine - defaults are well-reasoned
3. **Stay Focused**: Use `/remind` if AI goes off track
4. **Complete When Ready**: Don't feel obligated to answer every question

### For Requirements
1. **One Feature at a Time**: Keep requirements focused
2. **Think Implementation**: Consider how another AI will use this
3. **Document Decisions**: The "why" is as important as the "what"
4. **Link Everything**: Connect requirements to sessions and PRs
